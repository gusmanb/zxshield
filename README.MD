RECOMMENDED ENVIRONMENT

The code is developed in Visual Studio 2019 community edition. 

To develop the Arduino firmware I have used Visual Micro: https://www.visualmicro.com/
To develop the Spectrum programs I have used SpectNetIDE with Boriel Basic:
	https://github.com/Dotneteer/spectnetide
	https://github.com/boriel/zxbasic

From my experience this setup is gorgeous, only one IDE for all the system.
